# How Labor Policy in 2001 Influence Taiwanese Birth rate?

Abstract:

Low birth rate is a concern in many countries, including Taiwan, intend to solve this problem. The reason why the birth rate is declining is due to costs of raising children. Either the costs, such as education expense to bear a children, or the opportunity costs of female, such as their work, are the main reasons why the birth rate is declining. Though the governments have implemented many policies like compensation, those policies did not work well. The problem of raising a child seems to result from lacking time, which is a high opportunity cost compared to lacking money.

To estimate whether the reason why the birth rate is decreasing, this paper estimates how the enforcement of the two-days-off weekend policy, which lengthened the leisure time, influences the number of the children born. Since the policy was enacted in 2001, this paper takes the data from 1996-2000 and 2007-2011 using OLS and Poisson model to estimate the effect of the policy.

The empirical result presents that the labor policy that gives more leisure time to people do boost the birth rate.
